Hi, you can use this tool to monitor changes on a website. You can run it like `node index.js example.com 5` where example.com is the url you want to check and 5 is the timeout in seconds, interesting stuff:

- If you run into some 'sandbox' errors, [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md) is where you'll find answers
- You can change the treshold for reporting with a change on line 44
